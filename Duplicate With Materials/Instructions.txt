Duplicate with Materials is made for the purpose of creating Variants of an Object/Avatar quickly by Duplicating the target and replacing its materials with a new copy of them.

Steps:
1- Open the window (DreadTools > Utilities > Dupe with Mats)
2- Place your target in the Game Object field
3- Press "Create Variant".

This tool will duplicate your Target, replace all its materials and create a folder in the chosen path which contains the newly created materials.

Separate Shared Materials option: Materials that are reused accross multiple renderers will instead have a separate material for each material slot.
