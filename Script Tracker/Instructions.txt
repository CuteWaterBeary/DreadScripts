Script Tracker was made to offer protection against potentially malicious scripts and warn about possible hidden activities.
Malicious coders may attempt to steal your info, such as credentials or auth tokens. They may also attempt to cause damage to your device through the scripts.

The Script Tracker scans code based on Keywords written in the Script Tracker Settings. (Create > DreadScripts > Script Tracker Settings).
You can change the settings in the Editor Window (DreadTools > Scripts Settings > Script Tracker).
WARNING: DLLS CANNOT BE SCANNED OR REVISED! Always be warry of DLLs and only get them from trustworthy sources!

On first import of the Script Tracker, it's recommended to allow your current project's scripts if you trust them by clicking "Allow Current Project Scripts and DLLs"
to avoid getting prompted about scripts already present in the project.

When a script gets prompted you can:
	- Allow: Imports the script normally, and adds it to the whitelist.
	- Revise: Imports the script as a .txt file, and adds "Flags" to the lines that have triggered flags. After revision, you may either turn it back to .cs or delete it. To turn it back to a script .cs file, Right Click > Show in explorer. Right Click Script > Rename > Replace extension with .cs.
	- Delete: Deletes the script and its meta data, disallowing it from compiling or running anything.


Script Tracker Settings: Created through Assets > Create > DreadScripts > Script Tracker Settings
Contains Keywords that should be scanned for, Case-Insensitive.
	- Low Risk Flag: Flagged if any Low Risk keyword is found, ignores flag if allowed previously.
	- Normal Risk Flag: Flagged if any Normal Risk keyword is found, ignores flags if allowed previously and after verifying integrity*.
	- High Risk Flag: Flagged if any High Risk keyword is found, prompts any time it gets flagged.

*Verifying Integrity: Script Tracker will save a Hash of the allowed script and will compare the script to it when reimporting. So it will prompt if anything in the script was changed.
