# Limb Control  

<b>Feature Release</b>
--------------------
<b>Limb Control</b> allows you to control your limbs through Puppet Control with a few clicks.
Desktop users, you've got power now! Half body users, Kick those people that say you dun got legs!

Using "Same Control" makes the selected limbs be controlled using the same Puppet control.
You can also set your own BlendTree to move your limbs the way you want them to!
Besides that, you can also add <b>Tracking Control</b> which allows you toggle individual parts' tracking.

<b>Limb Control</b> is free and is available on my <a href="https://dreadrith.gumroad.com/l/LBControl">Gumroad</a>!
