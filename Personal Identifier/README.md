# Personal Identifier

This is the script which you have to import and use to generate a Personal ID if you want to purchase one of my Products. 
This Personal ID allows me to make sure my packages wouldn't be shared around freely and would only be used by your device.

<b>This script does not communicate with the internet and does not generate any kind of personal information or data of you or your device.</b>

The script was made into a DLL and Obfuscated to keep my security methods and important scripts Classified. This also causes the script to generate two console errors
when the script window is opened but is nothing to worry about.

It's okay to delete the ID Generator once you have your ID.
