Feature Release
Latest Version: v2.1.1
Last Updated: 30/01/2021

# Password Creator

Password Creator is made to limit access to the Avatar or its Features however you see fit. You can:
- Lock the Avatar, not allowing it to move nor track.
- Lock the Layers, stop certain things from working or changing.
- Lock the SubMenus, disallow access to certain menus and features

Password Creator Can:
- Save its state, only needs to be entered once
- Count mistakes to fully lock case there were too many failed attempts
- Have a Pre-Timer and a Post-Timer, to lock when chosen to or fully lock if not entered in time.
- Other minor features: Lock Animation, Manual Confirm, Integrated Menu, Input Open Animation, maybe more to come!

Password Creator is great for Creators! 
- You can use it as protection, with the existence of Re-Uploader and it being more common recently, this will help fend it off.
- You can use it to showcase a Demo/Trial Avatar, whose use time is limited or access to features is blocked, unless they know the password.
- You can use it to limit the access to friends, supporters, patrons, or whoever you'd like by giving them the access code. If the Avatar gets cloned, they won't get to use it depending on how you lock it unless they know the code.
