Saving Behaviour: Previously, Controller Editor used individual EditorPrefs for each value it needed to save, as well as a State and Transition to use as the default.
New behaviour now gets rid of all of that, only using one EditorPref and not requiring any asset.
This method is somewhat experimental and may uncommonly run into issues. If it does, you may have to clear settings through the window dropdown.
