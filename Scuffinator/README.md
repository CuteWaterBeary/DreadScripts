# DEMO
Unavailable for the public, read more about it in my server or contact me personally.

# Scuffinator
The Scuffinator is an "Anti-Rip" script that I have created myself that will protect your Avatar, Animations, Mesh Data, and your whole package in general and make it MUCH more difficult to work with your avatar or make any use of it if it were to be able to be ripped in the first place.

The Scuffinator has multiple features to ensure the security of your upload
![Features]()

# Scuff Armature
This will turn your Avatar into a jumble of fleshy mess upon ripping, making it mildly annoying to edit. This on its own isn't very effective but combined with the other features is a huge deal.
![ArmatureScuff]()

# Add Bugs
This will add a specified amount of "Bugs" to your avatar that are somewhat disguised and will make it nonsensical to work with. This has more to it that I cannot reveal but it serves a purpose to even have a single one :RiasShh: 
The avatar will have an additional polygon, skinned mesh renderer, and material slot per bug. The Renderer is disabled and the materials are removed so the bugs have no impact on performance. You may ask me to skip over this feature or specify the amount of bugs.

# Protect Animation
Can't reveal any details, just know that your animations won't be able to be ripped and will have altered animation path
Pre-rip
![AnimPreRip]()
Post-rip
![AnimPostRip]()

# Obfuscate Shaders
This is mild but it's something. Shaders don't get typically ripped properly, and materials usually lose their shaders. However rippers can look into the shader's name and be able to easily replace it if they know what it is. This feature simply renames the shader so that it's harder to figure out what shader it was.

# Scuff Blendshapes 
This will render your blendshapes empty upon ripping and unable to be used to make animations.
![ScuffShapes]()

# Scuff Bones
This utterly destroys an Avatar. Not only will it cause your Hierarchy to go completely missing upon ripping
![HierDest]()
But it will will also corrupt the Animator's Avatar, and make your Avatar unable to be muscle animated whatsoever. In other words, locomotion, sitting, jumping, all muscle animations are now void on this avatar.
![ScuffAvi]()
This has a by-product of causing all animations to lose their path considering the hierarchy has lost its names so none of the animations will work... If they were ripped properly to begin with

# Extra
Extra Protections that aren't detailed for ℂ𝕝𝕒𝕤𝕤𝕚𝕗𝕚𝕖𝕕 reasons:
~ Protection against exporting to blender
~ Protection against uploading the avatar
~ Protection against saving the scene, saving the avatar's prefab
~ Crashing the infamous ripping tool. Meaning that all of the above may not even reach unity to begin with.
![TinyCrash]()

# Info
This is completely script based, it does not mess with the SDK and is 100% ToS Friendly. I do not condone Ripping whatsoever. 
This is mostly effective against the tool mentioned above.
The Avatar will work as intended in-game with no repercussions.
Proof for the legitimacy of this protection is on my Discord server, you may also contact me for proof.
